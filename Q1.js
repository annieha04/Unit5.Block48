// Determine the validity of an input string s, which consists solely of the characters (, ), {, }, [, and ]. You need to check the following conditions: 

//   The opening brackets: 

//   - Must match with the corresponding closing brackets of the same type 
  
//   - Must be closed in the correct order 
  
//   - Should have a corresponding opening bracket of the same type


function isValid(s) {
    const stack = [];
    const openBrackets = ["(", "{", "["];
    const closingBrackets = [")", "}", "]"];
}
